## <a name="APIToc"></a>API Framework Documentation v2.1

The HyperPersonalized Intelligent Tutor (HPIT) is a schemaless, event driven system
which specializes in the communication between distributed intelligent tutoring systems 
and specialized, machine learning algorithms, which we call plugins. HPIT is a next 
generation system built on the backbone of open source web technologies.

Currently our tech stack consists of the following:

- Python 3.4
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Neo4j
- Flask
- Jinja2
- WTForms
- PyMongo
- SQLAlchemy
- PyCrypto
- Requests
- uWSGI
- Gears
- Twitter Bootstrap
- BackboneJS
- UnderscoreJS
- JQuery

At the most fundamental layer HPIT is a collection of RESTful web services that assist in
the routing of messages between tutors and plugins. On top of this web services layer 
we have built a client side library in the Python programming language to assist in 
the creation of tutors and plugins and their communication with HPIT.

HPIT is a publish and subscribe framework using event-driven methodologies. Tutors interact 
with the system by sending messages which consist of a named event and a data payload. 
Plugins can listen to these events, perform an action, then submit a response back to HPIT,
which will ultimately be routed to the tutor that made the original request.

In addition, HPIT provides several baseline plugins which perform basic functions related
to intelligent tutoring systems.

## <a name="TermToc"></a> Understanding Terminology

HPIT - HPIT consists of several modules and is sort of an all encompassing term for the entire 
system of modules.

Tutor - A tutor is an entity that interacts with students and uses the HPIT system to gather 
and analyze intelligent information about student performance. A tutor could be a game, or a web application,
a Flash game, or some other system that interacts with students in an effort to educate or train.

Plugin - An HPIT Plugin is a module that specializes in a very specific and narrow band of responsibility.
A plugin may exist inside of HPIT itself(at TutorGen) or on a network or system outside of HPIT. Regardless of
where the plugin sits it must communicate with the central HPIT router/server.

Entity - A generic term for either a Plugin or Tutor.

HPIT Manager - The manager is used to load the HPIT router, and a set of plugins and tutors. It
is used primarily for testing and development.

HPIT Router/Server - This is the central server that routes messages and transactions between tutors
and plugins.

HPIT Message - This is a event_name and payload pair, both of which are defined by the developer for
their plugin.

HPIT Transaction - A transaction is a message specifically for PSLC DataShop transactions.

##<a name="GetStartedToc"></a> Getting Started
###<a name="GSSystemRequirementsToc"></a>System Requirements
In order to install and run HPIT, you'll need the following system:
* Operating systems
    * Windows 7 or Windows 8.1
    * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    * OSX Mountain Lion or above
* Architecture
    * 64-bit processor
    * 32-bit processors will work in a limited fashion, but it is not recommended or supported
* Memory and Storage
    * Minimum 4 GB ram, 8 GB recommended
    * Minimum 2 GB hard disk, can scale up very quickly depending on your data volume
    * Solid state hard drives recommended

###<a name="GSInstallWindowsToc"></a> Installing HPIT on Windows
HPIT was designed to run on a Unix-like system, and Windows support is solely for development purposes.
Windows should not be used as an HPIT production server. 

#### Getting Started, Compilers.
First, to install HPIT, you'll need to install Microsoft Visual Studio.  The latest version should be fine; you can
find it at http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx.

Next, you'll need the GCC, most easily installed with MinGW.  You can get it from here: http://mingw.org/.

Make sure to add C:\MinGW\bin and C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin to your PATH environment variable.

#### Install Python 3.3.5, Pip and virtualenv
To install Python 3.3.5, download the binary from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and run.

To install Pip, go to http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html , download the get-pip.py script, and run with
`python get-pip.py`.

Verify you have the proper versions of Python and Pip:

`python --version`

`pip --version`

Next, install virtualenv using:

`pip install virtualenv`

Add C:\Python33\Scripts to your PATH so that pip and virtualenv are available commands.

#### Databases
HPIT uses four different database managers; MongoDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Neo4j.

#####MongoDB
Binaries available at http://www.mongodb.org/downloads.  Download and run.
You will need to create the directory C:\data\db to run MongoDB.

#####SQLite
Go to http://www.sqlite.org/download.html and download sqlite-shell-win32-\*.zip and sqlite-dll-win32-\*.zip.

Create the directory C:\sqlite.

Extract the contents of the .zip files to C:\sqlite. There should be three files:
* sqlite3.def
* sqlite3.dll
* sqlite3.exe

Add C:\sqlite to your PATH environment variable.

#####Neo4j
Go to http://neo4j.com/download/ and download the Community edition binary and install.

##### PostgreSQL
Because PostgreSQL is just a production replacement of SQLite, and Windows should never be used
as a production environment, this step is optional.  However, if you want to install PostgreSQL anyway,
there are binaries available at http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/.

To install the psycopg2 library on Windows, there are instructions located at http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/ and
are summarized here:

Download the 3.4 release for 64-bit processors.

Activate your virtual environment (covered later) and run 'easy_install psycopg2-2.5.4.win-amd64-py3.4-pg9.3.5-release.exe', replacing
the .exe in the command with the one you downloaded.

You'll need to add the bin directory of your PostgreSQL installation to PATH, so that `pg_config` is available to call.

####NodeJS
HPIT uses CoffeeScript and LESS for its front end, which requires NodeJS.

Binaries are available at http://nodejs.org/download/.

####Installing HPIT
#####Downloading HPIT and More Dependencies
Now we can install HPIT.  First, you will need the git command line tools.  They can be downloaded
from http://git-scm.com/download/win.

After git is installed, open up the Git Bash program, cd to your working directory (I used ~/Documents/HPIT) and run:

`git clone https://github.com/tutorgen/hpit_services`

Now it is time to create your virtual environment.  Switch back your your Windows Command Prompt.  It is important that you are using the 
correct Python binary when creating the virtual environment.  In our case, we used the command

`virtualenv -p C:\Python33\python.exe env`

Where virtualenv is the binary for the compatible version of virtualenv, C:\Python33\python.exe is your 
Python 3.3.5 binary, and env is the directory that the virtual environment will live in.

Next, activate the environment with the command `env\Scripts\activate.bat`.  Your command prompt
should now be prefixed with (env).

Now, find the directory env\Lib\distutils.  Add a file `distutils.cfg` with the contents:
    
    [build]
    compiler=mingw32
    
This tells Pip to use the MinGW compilers, which are required for some packages.

Now, install the Python dependencies using pip.  The command will be:

`pip install -r requirements-win.txt`

#####Configuring HPIT
First, make sure that MongoDB, and Neo4j are running.  HPIT is configured to use
SQLite for development, so PostgreSQL does not need to be started.  The databases can be 
controlled by these commands:

MongoDB:  `mongod`.  This will run in a terminal window until it is killed.

Neo4J: Run C:\Program Files\Newo4j Community\bin\neo4j-community.exe.  You can start and stop it
by clicking a button.

Next, set up the server settings.  Instructions are located in the section [Server Settings](#GSServerSettingsToc)

Now, seed the database with this command:

`python manage.py syncdb`

Optionally index the MongoDB for faster performance with this command:

`python manage.py indexdb`

And run the tests:

`python manage.py test`

Assuming everything passed, you should then run:

`python manage.py debug`

And browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000 , where you should see a welcome page.

If you run into problems, check the section [Common Hangups](#GSCommonHangupsToc)


###<a name="GSInstallMacOSXToc"></a> Installing HPIT on Mac OSX

#### Installing X-Code, Command Line Tools, and Homebrew
1. Go to the Apple Developer page. Here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action
2. If you don't have an apple developer account, create one.
3. Download Xcode and the Command Line Tools for your version os OSX.
4. Install Homebrew by running the following command: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"`
5. Install git with `brew install git`

#### Installing Python 3.4

1. Check to see if you have this version installed by default open up your terminal and enter `python3 --version`. 
2. To install Python 3.4 or higher we recommend you install it through homebrew with `brew install python3`

#### Installing the Databases

HPIT uses sqlite3 locally by default and for running it's test suite. If you are installing in production we recommend
that you confiqure HPIT to use postgreSQL over sqlite3.

1. `brew install mongodb sqlite`
2. (optional) Install postgresql with Postgres.app found here: http://postgresapp.com/

Install the libpq headers, using: `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`.  Try running `pg_config --version`
to ensure it installed correctly.

psycopg2 will be installed later with Pip.

#### Installing NodeJS and NPM

HPIT's administrative frontend relies heavily on CoffeeScript and LESScss. CoffeeScript and LESScss are NodeJS packages and so
you will need to download and install node version 0.10.3 to be able to run the HPIT server. Luckily on Max OSX this is a relatively trivial task.

* `brew install node`
* `npm install coffeescript-compiler less`

#### Installing Neo4J for the Hint Factory

If you plan on using the Hint Factory you will also need to have installed the Neo4J graph database. The best way to do so
is again, through Homebrew.

* `brew install neo4j`
* Start neo4j with `neo4j start`

#### Installing HPIT Itself

1. Clone the HPIT project from github: `git clone https://github.com/tutorgen/hpit_services hpit`
1. Change to the directory of the HPIT project: `cd hpit`
2. Create a reference to your python3 installation binary for virtualenv. `export PY3_PATH=$(which python3)`
3. Create a new virtual environment with: `virtualenv -p $PY3_PATH env`
3. Activate that environment with: `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install HPIT's dependencies with: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
7. Sync the configuration database with sqlite. `python3 manage.py syncdb`
8. Seed the Mongo Database with `python3 manage.py mongo`
9. (optional) Setup the MongoDB Indexes for faster performance. `python3 manage.py indexdb`
10. Start the MongoDB instance with `python3 manage.py mongo`
8. Run the test suite by typing `python3 manage.py test`

To start the HPIT server type: `python3 manage.py debug` and open your browser 
to http://127.0.0.1:8000. 

###<a name="GSInstallUbuntu12Toc"></a> Installing HPIT on Ubuntu 12.04
HPIT supports the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS release.  However, if possible, it is highly recommended to
upgrade to the 14.04 LTS release.

#### Getting Started
The first thing you'll need to do is update and upgrade your apt repositories:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get upgrade`


Next, install the C compiler and other build utilities:

`sudo apt-get install build-essential`

HPIT requires Python 3.4 or higher.  Ubuntu 12.04 does not include Python 3.4 in its
repositories by default, so you must install it from the fkrull/deadsnakes PPA:

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes`

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install python3.4`

You can verify you have the correct version of Python by typing:

`python3.4 --version`

Next, to install the numerous Python packages HPIT requires, you'll need Pip, which
needs to be compatible with Python 3.4.  The easiest way to do this is to use the 
command:

`python3.4 -m ensurepip --upgrade`


We highly recommend using virtualenv when running HPIT.  If you are unfamiliar with
virtualenv, you can read about it at http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/. 
Install virtualenv from pip, with the command:

`pip3 install virtualenv`

#### Databases
HPIT uses four different database managers; MongoDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j.

#####SQLite and MongoDB
Installing SQLite and MongoDB are easy to install, simply use apt-get:

`sudo apt-get install sqlite mongodb`

#####PostgreSQL
To install PostgreSQL, use the commands:

`sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

In order for Python to interact with PostgreSQL, we'll need the dependencies for the psycopg2 library.  Install
instructions are found at http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html#install-from-source , 
and summarized here:

Install the Python 3.4 headers, using: `sudo apt-get install libpython3.4-dev`.  This comes from
this fkrull/deadsnakes repository.

Install the libpq headers, using: `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`.  Try running `pg_config --version`
to ensure it installed correctly.

psycopg2 will be installed later with Pip.

#####Neo4j
Next, we need to install Neo4j.  Neo4j requires Oracle JDK 7 or OpenJDK 7.  You can verify this is installed
by using: `java -version`.

To install Neo4j, follow the steps located at http://debian.neo4j.org/ , summarized below:

`sudo wget -O - http://debian.neo4j.org/neotechnology.gpg.key| apt-key add - # Import Neo4j signing key`

`sudo echo 'deb http://debian.neo4j.org/repo stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list # Create an Apt sources.list file`

`sudo apt-get update # Find out about the files in our repository`

`sudo apt-get install neo4j # Install Neo4j, community edition`

####NodeJS
HPIT uses CoffeeScript and LESS for its front end, which requires NodeJS.  We recommend installing 
NodeJS from source to ensure you get the latest version.  At least 0.10.3 is required. 

First, download the source code.  At the time of writing, it was located at http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.31/node-v0.10.31.tar.gz.
You can use wget, like this:

`wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.31/node-v0.10.31.tar.gz`

Next, extract the archive.

`tar xvfz node-v0.10.31.tar.gz`

Now, cd into the node-v0.10.31.tar.gz directory, and run:

`./configure`

`make`

`sudo make install`

####Installing HPIT
#####Downloading HPIT and More Dependencies
Now that the dependencies are installed, we can install HPIT.  To do this, you will need git:

`sudo apt-get install git`

Next, clone the HPIT repository using:

`git clone https://github.com/tutorgen/hpit_services`

Next, move into the hpit_services directory using `cd hpit_services`

Now it is time to create your virtual environment.  It is important that you are using the 
correct Python binary when creating the virtual environment.  In our case, we used the command

`virtualenv -p python3.4 env`

Where virtualenv is the binary for the compatible version of virtualenv, python3.4 is your 
Python 3.4 binary, and env is the directory that the virtual environment will live in.

Next, activate the environment with the command `source env/bin/activate`.  Your command prompt
should now be prefixed with (env).

Now, install the Python dependencies using pip3.  The command will be:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

#####Configuring HPIT
First, make sure that MongoDB, and Neo4j are running.  HPIT is configured to use
SQLite for development, so PostgreSQL does not need to be started.  The databases can be 
controlled by these commands:

MongoDB:  `sudo service mongodb start`, `sudo service mongodb stop`

Neo4J: `sudo service neo4j-service start`, `sudo service neo4j-service stop`

Next, set up the server settings.  Instructions are located in the section [Server Settings](#GSServerSettingsToc)

Now, seed the database with this command:

`python manage.py syncdb`

Optionally, index the mongoDB wiht this command:

`python manage.py indexdb`

And run the tests:

`python manage.py test`

Assuming everything passed, you should then run:

`python manage.py start`

And browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000 , where you should see a welcome page.

If you run into problems, check the section [Common Hangups](#GSCommonHangupsToc)

###<a name="GSInstallUbuntu14Toc"></a> Installing HPIT on Ubuntu 14.04
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS release is the preferred platform for HPIT.

#### Getting Started
The first thing you'll need to do is update and upgrade your apt repositories:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get upgrade`


Next, install the C compiler and other build utilities:

`sudo apt-get install build-essential`

HPIT requires Python 3.4 or higher.  Ubuntu 14.04 comes pre-packaged with Python 3.4, with a 
binary named python3.

You can verify you have the correct version of Python by typing:

`python3 --version`

Next, to install the numerous Python packages HPIT requires, you'll need Pip, which
needs to be compatible with Python 3.4.  The easiest way to do this is to use the 
command:

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`


We highly recommend using virtualenv when running HPIT.  If you are unfamiliar with
virtualenv, you can read about it at http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

If you run into problems, check the section [Common Hangups](#GSCommonHangupsToc)

###<a name="GSServerSettingsToc"></a> The Settings Manager
The settings manager manages settings for the server and the pre-packages plugins that come with HPIT. The 
settings are first stored in JSON format, in a file called settings.json in the hpit_services root. When the
settings manager is imported and initialized, it will read this JSON file and load the values into a settings
object which then can be used project wide. This JSON file allows for multiple environment settings, for 
example, "test", "debug", and "production". By default, HPIT will look for the 'debug' settings but you can
override this by setting the HPIT_ENV environment variable i.e. (`export HPIT_ENV=production`). The structure 
of the file looks like this:

    json
    {
        "debug": {
            "plugin": {
                [plugin settings go here (see below)]
            },
            "server": {
                [server settings go here (see below)]
            }
        },
        "production": {
            "plugin": {
                [plugin settings go here (see below)]
            },
            "server": {
                [server settings go here (see below)]
            }
        }
    }

Most of these settings can be left as defaults, but the important ones to change are:
* PROJECT_DIR - should be set to the directory this README is in
* VENV_DIRNAME - shoule be a relative link from PROJECT_DIR to wherever the virtual environment is.
* MONGO_DBNAME / SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI - make sure these are different for test and production environments.

###<a name="GSCommonHangupsToc"></a> Common Hangups
Here's a list of common problems when trying to install HPIT:
* Permissions problems - if you're having troubles with permissions, make sure you are installing everything
in your user account, not root.
* Settings problems - make sure the settings are edited correctly for your system.  Verify that the paths to the
project directory and virtual environment are correct.
* Python problems - Make sure that Python, Pip, and virtualenv are all compatible with each other.
* Virtualenv problems - remember to activate your virtualenv when installing any python modules.  
* Enviornment Variable Problems - Remember to set the HPIT_ENV environment to map to the settings file.

## <a name="AdminToc"></a> The Adminstration Panel

After starting the HPIT server, create an account, then sign-in to your account. There is no confirmation 
page after registering. The system will just direct you back to the signin/register page. After logging in
two new options are available for you. 'My Plugins' and 'My Tutors'. On each of these pages you can register
new plugins and tutors, respectively. For each plugin or tutor you create HPIT will generate for you an Entity ID
(which never changes), and an API Key(which can change). The API Key will only be displayed once, if you lose 
it you'll have to generate another and update your plugin or tutor code to match the new key. You will need 
to supply the API key and Entity ID to HPIT for the plugin or tutor to connect to HPIT, and to send and 
retrieve messages. You can think of the Entity ID and API Key as a sort of username/password pair for connecting
your tutor or plugin to HPIT. Keep these two pieces of information secure. The Entity ID can be told and released
to others, but NEVER share your API Key with anyone.

The Docs page on the administration panel, shows these docs. The routes page on the administration panel shows
the web service endpoints that HPIT exposes to tutors and plugins.

##<a name="ManagerToc"></a> The HPIT Manager

The HPIT Manager can be used to quickly launch an HPIT server, configure plugins and tutors,
and monitor how data is being passed between entities within the HPIT system.

The HPIT manager can be run by typing: `python3 manage.py <command> <command_args>`

Depending on the command you wish to run the arguments to that command will vary. The command
line manager for HPIT will help you along the way. For example typing just `python3 manage.py`
will give you a list of commands that manager understands. Then typing 
`python3 manage.py your_command` will show you the arguments that that command can take and a
brief overview of what that command does.

Currently the HPIT Manager has the following commands:

* `python3 manage.py start` will start all locally configured tutors, and all locally configured plugins.
* `python3 manage.py stop` will stop all locally configured tutors, and all locally configured plugins.
* `python3 manage.py assets` will compile frontend assets together into a single file to ready for production deployments.
* `python3 manage.py debug` will run the HPIT server in debug mode and WILL NOT start any plugins or tutors.
* `python3 manage.py docs` copies this documentation file to the server assets directory.
* `python3 manage.py routes` lists all the routes that the HPIT Server/Router exposes to the web.
* `python3 manage.py syncdb` syncs the data model with the administration database.(PostgreSQL or Sqlite3)
* `python3 manage.py indexdb` strategically indexes the databases, and in particular MongoDB for faster performance.
* `python3 manage.py mongo <dbpath>` Initializes MongoDB database and starts the mongoDB server.
* `python3 manage.py test` runs the suite of tests for components within HPIT.
* `python3 manage.py admin` turns a user account into an admin, or deactivate admin for a user account.

##<a name="ConfigToc"></a> The Tutor and Plugin Configuration

The goals behind the HPIT manager is to give TutorGen a way to create and destroy large 
amount of entities for testing and evaluation of the software. Creating a new HPIT 
entity (tutor/plugin) adds it to the 'configuration.json'. Removing an HPIT entity 
removes it from the 'configuration.json' file. All entities within the configuration specify
6 things: 

1. Whether it is a tutor or plugin (by virtue of being in the tutor or plugin list)
2. active - Whether the plugin is currently running. (True if it is)
3. name - The name of the entity. This is how the entity will register itself with HPIT.
4. type - The subtype of the entity. e.g. 'example' or 'knowledge_tracer'
5. entity_id - The assigned Entity ID you got from creating the plugin or tutor in the administration panel.
6. api_key - The assigned API Key you got from creating the plugin or tutor in the administration panel.

Optionally, you can specify two optional parameters:

1. args - a json object for arguments that will be passed to the tutor or plugin
2. once - a boolean that tells the tutor or plugin to run only one time.

An example configuration would look like this:

    json
    {
        "tutors" : [
            {
                "name": "replay_tutor", 
                "args": {
                    "beforeTime": "02-11-2020 14:03:09", 
                    "filter": {
                        "event": "kt_trace"
                    }
                }, 
                "type": "replay", 
                "once": true, 
                "active": false, 
                "entity_id": "1234", 
                "api_key": "1234"
            }
        ],
        "plugins": [],
    }
    

## <a name="DatabaseToc"></a> Database Structure

HPIT uses a relational database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) for administrative purposes. This 
database manages, users, plugin authentication, tutor authentication, and plugin subscriptions.
By default this database is configured as SQLite and stored on the filesystem in the 
server/db subdirectory under HPIT. The models (tables) stored can be found in the server/models
directory or by running SQLite and using the command '.tables'.

The HPIT server uses a NoSQL MongoDB database to manage its messages and transactions. MongoDB uses a 
lazy creation policy, so the database and its collections are created only after elements are inserted,
and can be created with no prior configuration. The database contains five core collections:

### <a name="DBmessagesToc"></a> messages_and_transactions
A list of messages sent to the system before being duplicated to plugin_messages. Each message contains the following fields:

- message_name: "The type of the message. e.g. tutorgen.kt_trace"
- sender_entity_id: "The entity ID of the sender"
- payload: "The data being sent."
- time_created: "Date the message was created."

### <a name="DBpluginmesToc"></a> plugin_messages
Contains messages sent to plugins, as copied from the messages collection. It contains the following fields:

- receiver_entity_id: "The plugin that should recieve this message"
- message_name: "The type of the message. e.g. tutorgen.kt_trace"
- time_response_received: "The time the response was received (if any)"
- payload: "The data contained in this message."
- time_responded: "The time the response was created"
- time_received: "The time the message was processed by plugin"
- message_id: "The id of the message in the messages collection"
- time_created: "The time the message was created"
- sender_entity_id: "The entity ID of the sender"

### <a name="DBresponsesToc"></a> responses
Stores responses for tutors or other plugins to poll. It contains the following fields:

- response: "data for this response"
- message: "the original message"
- message_id: "The ID of the message in the messages collection"
- receiver_entity_id: "the Entity ID of the receiver"
- sender_entity_id: "The Entity ID of the sender"

### <a name="DBsent_messagesToc"></a> sent_messages_and_transactions
Stores plugin messages once they have been sent to plugin. It contains the following fields:

- receiver_entity_id: "The plugin that should recieve this message"
- message_name: "The type of the message. e.g. tutorgen.kt_trace"
- time_response_received: "The time the response was received (if any)"
- payload: "The data contained in this message."
- time_responded: "The time the response was created"
- time_received: "The time the message was processed by plugin"
- message_id: "The id of the message in the messages collection"
- time_created: "The time the message was created"
- sender_entity_id: "The entity ID of the sender"

### <a name="DBsent_responsesToc"></a> sent_responses
Store plugin responses once they have been sent to the original message sender (plugin or tutor). It contains the following fields:

- response: "data for this response"
- message: "the original message"
- message_id: "The ID of the message in the messages collection"
- receiver_entity_id: "the Entity ID of the receiver"
- sender_entity_id: "The Entity ID of the sender"
- time_response_received: "The time the response was processed"

### <a name="DBlogToc"></a> entity_log
Stores entity log information.  It contains the following fields:

- deleted: "Was this log deleted?
- log_entry: "The text of the log"
- created_on: "The date the log was created"
- entity_id: "The entity that created this log.

## <a name="ServerToc"></a> The HPIT Server in-depth

The HPIT Server is nothing more than an event-driven publish and subscribe framework, built
specifically to assist plugins and tutors to communicate via RESTful webservices. It is 
schemaless, has no pre-defined events, and is agnostic to the kinds of data it routes 
between plugins and tutors. In additon HPIT provides fundamental support for sessions,
authentication, message routing, and entity tracking.

Anyone can wrap these RESTful web services in a client side library and will be able to interact
with HPIT. We have delivered a client side library written in Python.

The server supports a variety of routes to handle the connection, polling, and transfer of 
data between HPIT entities. To get a list of these routes run the HPIT server with either 
`python3 manage.py debug` and open your browser to the HPIT administration page at 
http://localhost:8000/routes. Alternatively you can list the routes available with 
`python3 manage.py routes`

## <a name="TutorToc"></a> Tutors in-depth

A Tutor is an HPIT entity that can send messages to HPIT. A message consists of
an event name and a payload. The event name is an arbitrary string that defines what type
of message it is. Plugins register to listen to messages based on the event name. The 
message payload is an arbitrary JSON like document with data formatted based on plugin
requirements. The kinds of messages a tutor can send is defined by the plugins 
currently registered with HPIT. The HPIT server itself does not define what these 
messages look like, however HPIT does package some plugins as part of it's architecture.

For example the HPIT basic knowledge tracing plugin supports the following three events:

* tutorgen.kt_set_initial - Sets the initial values for the knowledge tracer on the KT Skill.
* tutorgen.kt_trace - Performs a knowledge tracing operation on the KT Skill.
* tutorgen.kt_reset - Resets the inital values for the knowledge tracer on the KT Skill.

Depending on the event name(eg tutorgen.kt_set_initial, or tutorgen.kt_trace) the payload 
the plugin expects will be different.

Tutors may also listen to plugin responses, and respond to them. Plugins may or may not
send a response depending on the plugin.

## <a name="ReplayToc"></a> Replay Tutors

HPIT comes with two replay tutors that are used for testing purposes.  The first is
the Replay Tutor, located in hpit/tutors/replay.py.  This tutor allows the user to
replay messages and transactions that were already sent to HPIT, essentially simulating
another tutor.  The Replay Tutor must run on the same computer as the HPIT router, as
it directly accesses the message routing database.

The Replay Tutor is usually run with a configuration in config.json along with the 
other plugins that are spun up in the HPIT environment.  The configuration should have
these parameters (along with those already necessary to run a tutor/plugin):
    - args, a dictionary of arguments, which most contain:
        - filter, an additional filter to query on
        - db_name, the name of the message routing database
        - (optional) beforeTime, specifies that messages before this time should be replayed
        - (optional) afterTime, specifies that messages after this time should be replayed
    - once, a boolean, if True, should only be run once, if false, it will continuously replay messages
    
Example configuration looks like this:
    {
        "active": false, 
        "type": "replay", 
        "args": {
            "filter": {}, 
            "db_name": "hpit_development", 
            "beforeTime": "02-11-2020 14:03:09"
        }, 
        "entity_id": "ed188aa3-a673-4482-9475-aedd981ff360", 
        "once": true, 
        "api_key": "e992a697f396a2fd99ef9910cb040fa9", 
        "name": "replay_tutor"
    }
    
Keep in mind that if the Replay Tutor has it's own entity_id, the results may vary from
what you would expect, since some plugins differentiate between senders.  In order to 
simulate another tutor, the Replay Tutor config should be set so that it uses the same
entity ID and API key as that tutor.
    
The second tutor is the Replay2 Tutor, located at hpit/tutors/replay2.py  This tutor's 
purpose is to replay PSLC Datashop transactions.  This tutor can run on any machine 
and interacts with HPIT like any other tutor would.  In order to use this plugin, 
datashop transactions must be imported.  These are in a tab delimited text format 
and can be obtained from the PSLC Datashop website.

After importing transactions, they can be selected in the GUI and sent to HPIT.  The 
responses are displayed in the bottom most text box.  It is also possible to knowledge trace
a skill and edit student attributes.  The Replay2 Tutor is good for testing existing
transactions from Datashop as well as specific functionality in some of HPIT's built in
plugins.  To run this tutor, use the command `python hpit/tutors/replay2.py`.

The Replay2 Tutor's config is hard coded near the bottom of the script, so make sure it
is edited to match your needs.
        
## <a name="EntityAuthToc"></a> Entity Authorization Model

When a plugin first subscribes to a new message it is now said to "own" that message type. For
example: Tutorgen owns the 'tutorgen.kt_trace' message type. We use this message internally in our
knowledge tracer. You are welcome to send 'tutorgen.kt_trace' messages from a tutor or plugin, and
our knowledge tracer will recieve the message and respond back to you with a result. However, If you 
were to write a plugin and try to subscribe to the 'tutorgen.kt_trace' message, the HPIT server 
would give you an access denied error because you don't "own" that message type. If you were curious
as to what entity "owned" a particular message, you can query the "message-owner" RESTFUL API endpoint
and we would tell you that plugin Entity ID: XXXXX owned it.

Now let's say you have a perfectly good reason to intercept a 'tutorgen.kt_trace' message, maybe you 
are a very tightly coupled partner of ours and we should give you the ability to read these messages,
we could, as the "Message Owner" can grant you access to intercept and handle messages of this type. This
is called an "Access Grant" and it is made by the owning entity when they send access grant information
to the 'share-message' RESTFUL API endpoint.

In addition to owning messages. Anyone entity can also "lock down" certain resources that they control, 
by requesting a new resource token from HPIT. In the future if that resource is attempted to be accessed
by someone you haven't given explicit permission to access, HPIT will prevent such a message from routing
through it's system. You can request new resource token with the 'new-resource' RESTFUL API endpoin.

If you want to share a resource token with another entity you can do so by sending a resource access grant
to the 'share-resource' RESTFUL API endpoint.

## <a name="TransactionToc"></a> Transactions

In HPIT, a transaction is supposed to be the smallest unit of interaction a student has with a tutor.  The
PSLC datashop uses transactions in its analysis of learning; it is the most fine grained representation of a
student's skill set.  Transactions can be generated by the student, like a key being press or an answer selected, 
or by the tutor, as in the tutor tells HPIT that the student was correct in answering a question.

Transactions act as a shortcut for the primary functionality of the main plugins in HPIT.  For example, when a 
student answers a question, they would want to tell HPIT to:

1. Get a student ID for this student, and a session
2. Add the skills to the skill manager, if they do not already exist
3. Run knowledge tracing for this set of skills
4. Record this problem in HPIT's database, if it is new to HPIT

A tutor could do this using the messages defined by HPIT's plugins, or they could send a single transaction.  That
transaction will be passed to each of the main plugins, and return the information they have gathered in a single call.  
Transactions should be the main way that tutors interact with HPIT.

A transaction requires these pieces of information:

* student_id : string - the HPIT ID of a student, usually gotten via a previous call to add_student or get_student
* session_id : string - the HPIT ID of a session, usually gotten via a previous call to add_student or get_student
* step_text : string - the unique step name
* problem_name : string - the unique problem name
* transaction_text : string - a unique string identifying the transaction 
* skill_names : dict - a mapping of skill models to skill names.  Required if using skill_ids.
* skill_ids : dict - a mapping of skill names to their IDS, usually gotten via get_skill_id.  Will be populated automatically if skill does not exist.  Should contain the same skills as skill_names.

Optional information includes:

* state : json - a hint factory state if hints are requested
* selection : string - a descriptor of the item being worked on ("text-area-1")
* action : string - the action being committed ("keypress")
* input : string - the input used ("Key-D")
* outcome : string - the result of the transaction, usually "correct", "incorrect", "hint"

Transaction Responses:

* skill_ids : dict - a dictionary mapping skill names and their IDs
* student_id : string - the ID of the student
* session_id : string - the ID of the session
* boredom_response : dict - response from the boredom detector
    * error : string - if an error occured, a message is presented here
    * bored : boolean - if the student is bored
* hf_response : dict - response from the hint factory
    * error : string - if an error occured, a message is presented here
    * hint_text : string - if hint requested, it will be here
    * hint_exists : boolean - true if hint exists
* kt_response : dict - response from the knowledge tracer
    * error : string - if an error occured, a message is presented here
    * traced_skills : dict - a dictionary of traced skills, similar to kt_trace's response
* problem_response : dict - response from the problem manager
    * error : string - if an error occured, a message is presented here
    * problem_id : string - the problem ID this transaction belongs to
    * step_id : string - the step ID this transaction belongs to
    * transaction_id : string - the ID of this transaction
* skill_response : dict - response from the skill manager
    * skill_ids : dict - a dictionary mapping skill names and their IDs
* student_response : dict - the response from the student manager
    * student_id : string - the ID of the student
    * session_id : string - the ID of the session
    

An example transaction payload looks like this:

    json
    {
        'skill_names': {
            'Unique-step': 'KC293', 
            'Default': 'same',

Transactions are sent by the tutor's send_transaction() method, which uses the API's /transaction endpoint.

## <a name="PluginToc"></a> Plugin Component Specification

A Plugin is an HPIT entity that subscribes to (listens to) certain event names, receives
transaction payloads, performs some arbitrary function based on the event and message
payload, and may or may not return a response to the original sender of the message.

A plugin may listen to and define any events it wishes. When a tutor sends a message 
to HPIT, if a plugin has registered itself with HPIT, and if that plugin and subscribed
to the event name submitted with the tutor's message, it will receive a queued list
of messages when it polls the HPIT server for data. It is expected that plugins will
do this type of polling periodically to see if any new messages have been queued for 
processing by HPIT.

When a plugin processes an event from HPIT, it will receive all the information in the 
original message, including the information identifying the tutor that sent the
message. This identifying information is called the entity_id of the tutor.

A plugin may send a response to HPIT by providing the original message id, along with 
a response payload, which will be sent to the original sender of the message message.

It is possible for plugins to send messages like tutors and respond to messages
like tutors. In this way, it is possible for plugins to listen to, and re-fire event 
messages while altering the event name of the message so that other dependent 
plugins can also respond to the original transaction. This can create a daisy chaining
effect where plugins fire in series to process a complex series of messages.

##<a name="ExPlugin"></a> Example Plugin

The example plugin listens to the `test` and `example` event names and logs
whatever data it's sent in the payload to a file.
